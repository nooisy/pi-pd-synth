# Things you'll need
- Raspberry Pi (we used the fourth iteration of the microprocessing unit commonly known as the Raspberry Pi)
- adapter to power your Pi
- micro SD card, at least 8gb
- ethernet cable
- usb to ethernet adapter
- audio interface (we used a Focusrite Scarlett 2i4)
- midi controller of some sort
- a device – or more precisely: a transducer – that converts sound into an electrical signal (you might call it a microphone)
- speakers

# Installation guide
#### Step 1: Raspberry Pi
Download a Raspbian image from the [Raspberry Pi site](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/). We recommend Raspbian Buster with desktop. Write your downloaded image to your SD card. On Windows you can use [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/). To enable SSH you'll need to a make an empty file called `ssh` (without an extension!) and place it in the root of your SD card. That's it, really.

#### Step 2: Making a connection
Now it's time to grab your ethernet cable and usb to ethernet adapter. Connect the ethernet cable to your adapter and Pi. Connect the usb to your already working computer. To allow your Raspberry Pi to connect to the internet, you'll need to share your already working computer's internet connection with your Pi. On Windows you'll need to change your adapter properties:
